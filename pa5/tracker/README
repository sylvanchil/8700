Project no: 5
Project due date: Nov. 25, 2015

About project 5:
key 'w','a','s','d' to move around
key 'space' to shoot. 
key 'g' to toggle god mode.
key 'r' to reset the game.
key 'f1' to toggle hud.
explosion effect is not implemented yet, but collision detection works fine. When player crash into enemies plane, it shows "collide the plane", when bullet hits enemeis, it shows "collided"

Bug:
1.player control is not correctly implemeted.
2.Explosion hasn't implemented yet.
3.As a prototype, performance is not the first priority. Memory fragmentaton is a problem.
